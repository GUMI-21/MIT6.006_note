## DAA sort
If the items to be sorted have unique keys from a bounded positive range {0, . . . , u − 1} (so n ≤ u),
Inserting takes time Θ(n) time while initializing and scanning the direct access array takes Θ(u) time, so this sorting algorithm runs in Θ(n + u) time. If u = O(n), then this algorithm is linear!
